# Azure Well Architected Playbook and Toolkit

This repository contains a playbook and toolkit for Azure architects and engineers willing to put the [Well Architected Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/) into practice.

**IMPORTANT**: this is work in progress and will be released once it matures enough to be relevant to the overall Azure community. However unfinished, you'll find here many ideas and tools that may very well help you in your Well-Architected journey.

The playbook is organized as follows:

1. [Cost Optimization](cost-optimization/)
2. [Operational Excellence](operational-excellence/)
3. [Performance Efficiency](performance-efficiency/)
4. [Reliability](reliability/)
5. [Security](security/)

For each Well-Architected pillar, you'll find:

* some fundamental questions that you must ask to assess whether you need to improve the quality of your Azure workload.
* a checklist of actions and validations that you should pursue.
* a set of tools that will be useful for putting into practice well architected principles.
