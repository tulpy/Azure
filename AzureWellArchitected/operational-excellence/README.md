TODO: detail initiatives

## Questions to make 

* Have you defined key scenarios for your workload and how they relate to operational targets and non-functional requirements?
* How are you monitoring your resources?
* How do you interpret the collected data to inform about application health?
* How do you visualize workload data and then alert relevant teams when issues occur?
* How are you using Azure platform notifications and updates?
* What is your approach to recovery and failover?
* How are scale operations performed?
* How are you managing the configuration of your workload?
* What operational considerations are you making regarding the deployment of your workload?
* What operational considerations are you making regarding the deployment of your infrastructure?
* How are you testing and validating your workload?
* What processes and procedures have you adopted to optimize workload operability?
