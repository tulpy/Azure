## Abnormal port to protocol

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzure-Network-Security%2Fmaster%2FAzure%2520Firewall%2FQueries%2520and%2520Alerts%2FAbnormal%2520port%2520to%2520protocol%2FAbnormalPortToProtocol.json)

### Scope
This alert can indicate malicious communication (C2) or exfiltration by attackers trying to communicate over known ports (22:SSH, 80:HTTP) but donâ€™t use the known protocol headers to match the port number.

### How it works
The alert searches for abnormal protocol on port based on learning period activity

Configurable Parameters:
- Learning period time - learning period for protocol learning in days. Default is set to 7.

```
let LearningPeriod = 7d;
let RunTime = 1d;
let StartLearningPeriod = LearningPeriod + RunTime;
let EndRunTime = RunTime - 1d;
let LearningPortToProtocol = (AzureDiagnostics
| where OperationName == "AzureFirewallApplicationRuleLog"
| parse msg_s with protocol " request from " srcip ":" srcport " to " dsturl ":" dstport "." *
| where isnotempty(dstport)
| where TimeGenerated between (ago(StartLearningPeriod) .. ago(RunTime))
| summarize LearningTimeCount = count() by LearningTimeDstPort = dstport, LearningTimeProtocol = protocol);
let AlertTimePortToProtocol = (AzureDiagnostics
| where OperationName == "AzureFirewallApplicationRuleLog"
| parse msg_s with protocol " request from " srcip ":" srcport " to " dsturl ":" dstport "." *
| where isnotempty(dstport)
| where TimeGenerated between (ago(RunTime) .. ago(EndRunTime))
| summarize AlertTimeCount = count() by AlertTimeDstPort = dstport, AlertTimeProtocol = protocol);
AlertTimePortToProtocol 
| join kind=leftouter (LearningPortToProtocol) on $left.AlertTimeDstPort == $right.LearningTimeDstPort
| where LearningTimeProtocol != AlertTimeProtocol
```
