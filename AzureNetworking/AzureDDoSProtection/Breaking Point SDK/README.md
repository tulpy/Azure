# Breaking Point API Script

This script can be used to automate DDoS testing by running once or using cron to schedule regular tests. This is useful to validate that your logging is configured properly and that detection and response procedures are effective. The scripts require a Linux OS (tested with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS) and Python 3. Install prerequisites and API client using the included script or by using the documentation on the Breaking Point website.
