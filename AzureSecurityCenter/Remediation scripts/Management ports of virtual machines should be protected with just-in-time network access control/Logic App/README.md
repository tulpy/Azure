# Logic Apps sample to remediate

This logic app will find all security recommendations for JIT VM Access and create access policies for each VM for ports 22 and 3389.
The automation leverages a "Managed Identity" which needs to be configured after deployment. This "Managed Identity" also requires the appropriate subscription permissions (contributor) on the resources (subscriptions, tasks, and VMs) that you would like to remediate.
