# Script to remediate unhealthy virtual machines found on the vulnerability assessment recommendation

This script uses Azure Resource Graph query to get all unhealthy/applicable resources (virtual machine and Azure Arc connected servers) found on the **A vulnerability assessment solution should be enabled on your virtual machines** recommendation.
For each applicable resource, a REST API call is executed to deploy the vulnerability assessment scanner powered by Qualys.

> Please note, it takes up to 24 hours for the recommendation to update the state of existing resources, so you might see resources that have been remediated still appear on the unhealthy tab.

## Requirements

- To run this script, you must:
  - Install both `Az.Accounts`, `Az.ResourceGraph` PowerShell modules.
  - Authenticate to Azure using `Connect-AzAccount` cmdlet.
