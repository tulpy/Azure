# ASC Secure Score by Groups
**Author: Fernanda Vela | Program Manager, CxE Azure Security Center**

This workbook displays the Azure Security Center overall Secure Score of groups of subscriptions. By default, it will load four groups; in each of them, you select the subscriptions that represent a group.

To deploy the workbook you will need **writing permissions** in the subscription where it will be stored. To view the information, you will need **reader permissions** of all subscriptions that are in the defined groups.
