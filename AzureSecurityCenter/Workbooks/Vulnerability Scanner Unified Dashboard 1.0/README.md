# ASC Built-in Vulnerability Scanner Unified Dashboard 1.0
This Workbook provides an unified view on the information collected by the the following recommendations from Azure Security Center:
- Vulnerabilities in your **virtual machines** should be remediated
- Vulnerabilities in **Azure Container Registry images** should be remediated (powered by Qualys)
- Vulnerability assessment findings on your **SQL servers** on machines should be remediated

- The **first row** provides a summary of the number of Servers scanned (Azure + Azure ARC servers), the number of Azure Container Registries where vulnerabilities were found and number of SQL Servers scanned (Azure + Azure SQL ARC Servers). 
- The **second row** provides high level summary of the severities found for each workload type and severity (High, Medium and Low)
- The **the third row** provides a table with a list of each resource assessed (clicking on the resource link will redirect you to the resource itself) and a summary of the number of vulnerabilities per severity (High, Medium, Low).

## Servers Tab

- The **first row** provides a table with a list of each Server assessed (Azure Servers on the left and ARC Servers on the right) detailing the number of vulnerabilities found, the number of vulnerabilities per severity (High, Medium and Low), the number of patchable vulnerabilities and the number of CVE's found.
- The **second row** provides a table where all vulnerabilities found are listed. The search box can be used to filer recommendations based on Resource, Resource Type, CVE, Severity, Keywords, etc.
