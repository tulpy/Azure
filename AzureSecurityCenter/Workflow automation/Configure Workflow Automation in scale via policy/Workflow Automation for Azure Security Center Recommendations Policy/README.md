## Assign the custom policy

After the deployment, you should assign the policy and set the desired scope and input parameters.
To auto-create remediation tasks for existing subscriptions under the assignment scope, during the assignment on Remediation tab check "Create a remediation task".

## Remediate new subscriptions

To create automation on newly created subscriptions, open the Compliance tab, select the relevant non-compliant assignment and create a remediation task. Repeat this step when you have one or more new subscriptions you want to run the automation on.
