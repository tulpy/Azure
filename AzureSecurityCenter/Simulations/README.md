# Azure Security Center Simulation Playbook

There are many ways to simulate an alert in Azure Security Center and if you just want a simple validation to get an alert, use the procedures described in [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-alert-validation). For a more scenario-based approach, you have the resources below that you can use to validate different threat detections capabilities available in Azure Security Center.

## Alert Simulation for Windows (Azure and Non-Azure VMs)

- Download this [PDF](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Security-Center/blob/master/Simulations/Azure%20Security%20Center%20Security%20Alerts%20Playbook_v2.pdf) and follow the steps to configure a lab environment to test Windows VM-based threat detection.

- [Potential alerts for Windows documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/alerts-reference#alerts-windows)

If you are testing the integration with Microsoft Defender ATP for Servers, use [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-wdatp#test-the-feature) to validate the alert integration. Make sure that the server that you are testing this procedure is already onboarded and using MDATP.

## Alert Simulation for Linux (Azure and Non-Azure VMs)

- Download this [PDF](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Security-Center/blob/master/Simulations/Azure%20Security%20Center%20Linux%20Detections_v2.pdf) and follow the steps to configure a lab environment to test Linux VM-based threat detection.
