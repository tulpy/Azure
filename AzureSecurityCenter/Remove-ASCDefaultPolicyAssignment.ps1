    - Initial script

.DESCRIPTION
This script can be used when there are dual levels of ASC policies assignments at Management group and subscription level. If you want ASC policy to be inherited correctly at
the management group, this script Removes ASC Default policy assignment at subscription level by doing the following:
  1. Loop through all management groups and a match for a ASC Default definition in policy assignment at Management Group Level.
  2. Loop through all subscrptions within the managemnt group, Looking for the following policy assignment name 'ASC Default' applied at subscription level.
  3. If a match is found, the policy assignment is removed.
