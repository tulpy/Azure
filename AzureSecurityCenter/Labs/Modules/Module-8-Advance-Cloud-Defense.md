### Exercise 1: Using JIT to reduce attack surface

1.	From Security Center sidebar, click on **Azure Defender**.
2.	On the Advanced protection part at the bottom, click on **Just-in-time VM access** (You should see 2 unprotected status).

3.	On the Just-in-time VM access page, select the **Not configure** tab. You should see two virtual machines listed: `asclab-linux` and `asclab-win`.
4.	Select **asclab-win** and then click on the **Enable JIT on 1 VM** button.

5.	On the JIT VM access configuration, keep just the **3389 (RDP) port and remove all the others**. To remove, click on the ellipses and then **Delete**.
6.	Click **Save** to apply the VM access configuration.

7.	Review the **Configured** tab, now you should see your VM configured: `asclab-win`.
8.	On the Azure portal sidebar, click on **Virtual Machines**.
9.	Click on **asclab-win**.
10.	From the top menu, click on **Connect** button and then select **RDP**.

11.	On the Connect with RDP, click on the **Download RDP file anyway** button. Alternatively, from the VM blade, look for the Public IP address and try to connect using RDP.
12.	Click on the downloaded file to initiate a remote connection to the server. On the warning message, **ignore the message by clicking on Connect**.
13.	You should see the following error message: *Remote Desktop can't connect to the remote computer*. In our scenario, the remote access to the server is not enable.
14.	Return to the VM blade. On the Connect page, request JIT access. On the **Source IP**, select **My IP** and then click on **Request access**. You should now see the following message: *Access approved on port 3389 from the selected IPs. You can now connect.*
15.	Try to connect again to validate your JIT access to the VM. Use the same file you downloaded previously.
16.	Now you should get the prompt for the local admin credentials. **Type your username and password** and click **OK**.
17.	You **are now connected to asclab-win** server. Close the remote control session/log off.

### Exercise 2: Adaptive Application Control

Application control helps you deal with malicious and/or unauthorized software, by allowing only specific applications to run on your machines.

1.	From Security Center sidebar, click on **Azure Defender**.
2.	On the Advanced protection part at the bottom, click on **Adaptive application control** (you should see 2 unprotected status).
3.	The Adaptive application controls page opens with your VMs grouped into the following tabs: Configured, Recommended and No recommendations.
4.	Click on the **Recommended** tab.
5.	If this tab does not contain any group yet, it means that Security Center needs at least two weeks of data to define the unique recommendations per group of machines.

### Exercise 3: File Integrity Monitoring

File integrity monitoring (FIM), also known as change monitoring, examines operating system files, Windows registries, application software, Linux system files, and more, for changes that might indicate an attack.
It maps the current state of these items with the state during the previous scan and alerts you if suspicious modifications have been made. To enable FIM, follow the instructions below:

1.	From Security Center sidebar, click on **Azure Defender**.
2.	On the Advanced protection part at the bottom, click on **File Integrity Monitoring** tile.
3.	On the FIM configuration page, select the **Log Analytics workspace listed** `asclab-la-xxx` (or just by clicking on the Upgrade icon - it indicates that FIM is not enabled for the selected workspace).
4.	On the Enable FIM, **review the default recommended settings** for Windows files, Registry and Linux files.
5.	Click on **Enable File Integrity Monitoring** button.
