> Note: Exporting Security Center's data also enables you to use experiences such as integration with 3rd-party SIEM and Azure Data Explorer.

10.	On the Azure portal, navigate to **Log Analytics workspaces** service or [click here](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.OperationalInsights%2Fworkspaces).
11.	Click on the **asclab-la-xxx** workspace.
12.	From the workspaceâ€™s sidebar, click on the **Logs** button.
13.	On the welcome page, click on the **Get Started** button and then **close the Queries window**.
14.	From the left pane, notice the following tables: `SecureScores`, `SecureScoreControls`, `SecurityAlert`, `SecurityRecommendation` and `SecurityNestedRecommendation`.
